_MOBY Zine. Columbia University 2024_

MOBY (Marine Observational Behavior Yielder) is a whale data tag conceptualized by me and my lovely senior design group at Columbia University. It seeks to fill the gaps in current tags and is a non-invasive data tag with improved longevity via biomimetic improvements, energy regeneration, and camera orientation control.

Lots of love and creativity went into making MOBY- this zine I designed being one of the ways we wanted to be able to convey our idea clearly to anyone.
